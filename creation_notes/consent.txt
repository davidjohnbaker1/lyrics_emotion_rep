"I consent to serve as a participant in a research investigation that focuses on the memory abilities and reaction times of both children and adults. The study is entitled “An Investigation of Cognitive Processes” sponsored by Louisiana State University and is to be conducted under the direction of Emily Elliott, Ph.D.<br>I understand that the study will involve these procedures:  In the presence of one of the members of the research team, I will engage in a task with visual (lyrics) and aural stimuli (music).  Then I will be asked to indicate my response to the visual (lyrics) and aural stimuli through a nonverbal response such as a computer keypress or mouse-click. 
Refusal to consent to participate will involve no penalty.  I understand that I am free to withdraw my consent and discontinue participation at any time without penalty.  I will receive the agreed-upon reward for the session even if I withdraw from the study before it is complete.  I understand that this study is not expected to involve risks or harm any greater that those ordinarily encountered in daily life.  I understand also that it is not possible to identify all potential risks in an experimental procedure, but that all reasonable safeguards will be taken to minimize the known and unknown potential risks. 
The study has been discussed with me and all my questions have been answered. I may direct additional questions regarding study specifics to Emily Elliott, (225)578-7460. If I have questions about subjects' rights or other concerns, I can contact Dennis Landin, Chairman, LSU Institutional Review Board, irb@lsu.edu, (225)578-8692. I agree to participate in the study described above and acknowledge the researchers' obligation to provide me with a copy of this consent form if signed by me."
