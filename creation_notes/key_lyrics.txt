Fill your days with music
With tender, joyful song,
Dream your dreams to music,
You’ll help your dreams along

The Owl and the Pussycat went to sea
In a beautiful pea-green boat,
They took some honey, and plenty of money,
Wrapped up in a five pound note.
The Owl looked up to the stars above,
And sang to a small guitar

3

We get it almost every night
When that moon is big and bright
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight

4

It's a lovely night, one of the first in some good time
For all of my years, i've been living by the rules of your smile
There's a lot to recover from that night out
When you leaned in and whispered, "yeah I'm trying to take you out."

5

At the cry of the first bird
They began to crucify Thee, O Swan!

6

So far from each other,
While the days pass in their emptiness away,
Oh my love, must it be forever,
Never once again to meet as on that day,
And never rediscover the way of telling,
The way of knowing all our hearts would say.

7

Ev’ry time we say goodbye,
I die a little
Ev’ry time we say goodbye,
I wonder why a little

"
<p>
But I can read between the lines <br>
I want to run from everything<br>
But my legs won't work, it's clear to me<br>
I haven't been much myself<br>
And I feel like my friends are being put through this hell I'm feeling<br>
I think that I'm living, if you could call it living<br>
So brash and unforgiving' <br>
Ruled by the vibe I'm bringing<br>
Serving myself<br>
</p>

Goodnight room
Goodnight moon
Goodnight cow jumping over the moon


10

Your hands lie open in the long, fresh grass,
The finger-points look through like rosy blooms:
Your eyes smile peace.


11
I was a little girl alone in my little world,
Who dreamed of a little home for me.
I played pretend between the trees,
And fed my house guests bark and leaves,
And laughed in my pretty bed of green.
I had a dream that I could fly from the highest swing,
I had a dream.


12

I wish you bluebirds in the spring,
To give your heart a song to sing,
And then a kiss, but more than this,
I wish you love.

13

My child is dead. John's mother is dying...
My own life is in danger.
I ask you for help, and all you give me is... papers!Papers! Papers! Papers!

14

A leopard went around his cage
from one side back to the other side;
he stopped only when the keeper came around with meat;
A boy who had been there three hours
began to wonder, “Is life anything like that?”

15

Running around, staying out all night
Taking it all instead of taking one bite
Living with you’s just putting me through it all of the time.
I could leave but I won’t go,
It’d be easier I know.
I can’t feel a thing from my head down to my toes
But why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you, you looking at me,
It’s always the same, it’s just a shame, that’s all.

16

If you think I'll take you back
Your in for a surprise
You'll never be the one for me. 
Second time around I know
You gotta pay the price
You got to be, you're not to be. 
Fi you think I'll let you play 
This game not once, but twice
There will be no more miss nice.
