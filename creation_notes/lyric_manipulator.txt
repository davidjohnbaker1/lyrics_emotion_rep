"<p>The Owl and the Pussycat went to sea<b>In a beautiful pea-green boat,<b>They took some honey, and plenty of money,<b>Wrapped up in a five pound note.<b>The Owl looked up to the stars above,<b>And sang to a small guitar<b></p>"

"<p>We get it almost every night<b>When that moon is big and bright<b>It's a supernatural delight<b>Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight<b></p>"

"<p>It's a lovely night, one of the first in some good time<b>For all of my years, i've been living by the rules of your smile<b>There's a lot to recover from that night out<b>When you leaned in and whispered, "yeah I'm trying to take you out."<b></p>"

"<p>At the cry of the first bird<b>They began to crucify Thee, O Swan!<b></p>"

"<p>So far from each other,<b>While the days pass in their emptiness away,<b>Oh my love, must it be forever,<b>Never once again to meet as on that day,<b>And never rediscover the way of telling,<b>The way of knowing all our hearts would say.<b></p>"

"<p>Ev’ry time we say goodbye,<b>I die a little<b>Ev’ry time we say goodbye,<b>I wonder why a little<b></p>"

"<p>But I can read between the lines <br><b>I want to run from everything<br><b>But my legs won't work, it's clear to me<br><b>I haven't been much myself<br><b>And I feel like my friends are being put through this hell I'm feeling<br><b>I think that I'm living, if you could call it living<br><b>So brash and unforgiving' <br><b>Ruled by the vibe I'm bringing<br><b>Serving myself<br><b></p><b>"<b></p>"

"<p>Goodnight room<b>Goodnight moon<b>Goodnight cow jumping over the moon<b></p>"

"<p>Your hands lie open in the long, fresh grass,<b>The finger-points look through like rosy blooms:<b>Your eyes smile peace.<b></p>"

"<p>I was a little girl alone in my little world,<b>Who dreamed of a little home for me.<b>I played pretend between the trees,<b>And fed my house guests bark and leaves,<b>And laughed in my pretty bed of green.<b>I had a dream that I could fly from the highest swing,<b>I had a dream.<b></p>"

12

"<p>I wish you bluebirds in the spring,<b>To give your heart a song to sing,<b>And then a kiss, but more than this,<b>I wish you love.<b></p>"

"<p>My child is dead. John's mother is dying...<b>My own life is in danger.<b>I ask you for help, and all you give me is... papers!Papers! Papers! Papers!<b></p>"

"<p>A leopard went around his cage<b>from one side back to the other side;<b>he stopped only when the keeper came around with meat;<b>A boy who had been there three hours<b>began to wonder, “Is life anything like that?”<b></p>"

15

"<p>Running around, staying out all night<b>Taking it all instead of taking one bite<b>Living with you’s just putting me through it all of the time.<b>I could leave but I won’t go,<b>It’d be easier I know.<b>I can’t feel a thing from my head down to my toes<b>But why does it always seem to be<b>Me looking at you, you looking at me,<b>It’s always the same, it’s just a shame, that’s all.<b></p>"

16

"<p>If you think I'll take you back<b>Your in for a surprise<b>You'll never be the one for me. <b>Second time around I know<b>You gotta pay the price<b>You got to be, you're not to be. <b>Fi you think I'll let you play <b>This game not once, but twice<b>There will be no more miss nice. <b></p>"
